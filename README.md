# Connectly Project

Connectly is a simple social media web app where users can create profiles, post content, follow others, and engage through likes and comments.
This project was built as part of an academic activity for `MO-IT152 | IPT`, focusing on building secure, API-driven Django applications.



## Features:

- User registration, login, and Google OAuth integration
- Create, update, and delete posts
- Like posts and comments
- Follow/unfollow other users
- Paginated news feed (sorted by date)
- Secure authentication with token-based access
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and protected endpoints
- Fully functional REST API for frontend/mobile integration

---

## Tech Stack:

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Authentication:** Token-based auth + Google OAuth (via `dj-rest-auth`, `allauth`)
- **Database**: SQLite (for development)
- **Security**: HTTPS (via self-signed certificate), password encryption, RBAC
- **Tools:** Postman for API testing, GitHub for version control
